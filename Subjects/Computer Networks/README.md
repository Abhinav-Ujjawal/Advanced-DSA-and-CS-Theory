#Geeks for Geeks
  **Socket**: Unique combination of IP address and port 
  **DNS**: It is basically a server translates (domain to ip)
  **Router**: Connects 2 or more ip networks or subnetworks
  **Hub**: Connectin multiple ethernets together
  **Bridge**: Interconnect two LAN's
  **ARP PROTOCOL**: Convert ip addr to Mac addr, Used by Datalink layer
  **URL and URI**: URL is a subset of URI, URL = (protocol + websitename + Top_Level_Domain + path)

# Transmission mode in Computer Networks
    (i) Simple :- Communication always unidirectional ( ---> or <---) eg: Keyboard
   (ii) Half Duplex :- Communication is in both directions but not at the same time(<---->)  eg: Walkie-Talkie
  (iii) Full Duplex :- Communication is in both directions simultaneously at same time eg: Telephone line

# Unicast, Multicast, Boardcast  
   (i) Unicast(1 - 1)
  (ii) Multicast(1 - set of receivers)
 (iii) Broadcast(1 - all the participants in the network)
 
**If Direct Broadcast Address of subnet is 201.15.16.31. Which of the following will be subnet mask ?**
(A) 255.255.255.240
(B) 255.255.255.192
(C) 255.255.255.198
(D) None Of the Above

Answer: (D)
Explanation: Last octet of given DBA is 0001 1111. So, in Subnet mask address all should be 1â€™s except last 5 digits, i.e., 255.255.255.224.

**If subnet mask 255.255.255.224, which of the following will be Direct Broadcast address ?**
(A) 202.15.19.127
(B) 202.15.19.63
(C) Both a and b
(D) None of the Above

Answer: (C)
Explanation: Subnet mask is   255.255.255.1110 0000
In DBA all host bits are 1.
from option 202.15.19.011 11111 , this can be a DBA.
202.15.19.001 11111 ,this can also be a DBA.
  
# Classifications of Computer Networks
  Most widely used models are Open Systems Interconnection and Department of Defense(TCP/IP)
  1. Local Area Network(LAN)
     LAN - Devices
      (i)Wired ( eg: Ethernet - Hub, Switch(Indermediate things)
      (ii)Wireless( eg: Wifi)
  2. Metropolitan Area Network(MAN)
     More than 2 LAN'S connected in particular area
     Devices: Switches/Hub
              Routers/Bridges
  3. Wide Area Network(WAN) - telecommunications networks(large area)
     More than 2 MAN'S connected
  
  **A host can acts as a Client when he is requesting information.**
  **A host can acts as a Server when he provides information.**
  **A host can also request and provide information, which is called Peer.** 

# Types of Network Topology (Layout)
   1. Bus
       Data is transmitted over common transmission medium
       No security
            A
            |      |      |
            |      |      |
            |      |      |    Terminator
      ----------------------------
                |      |
                |      |
                |      |
                       B
       
   2. Ring (Unidirectional)
       It is a BUS Topology in a closed loop, Peer-to-Peer LAN 
       Sending and receiving data takes place with the help of a Token(Token is circulated through out the network)
       No Security
       
   3. Star
       Every node is connected to a central node called "hub or switch". It is centralized
       
       
                     \     |      /
                      \    |     /
                       \   |    /
                        \  |   /
               _ _ _ _ _   Hub  _ _ _ _ _ 
                         /  |
                        /   |
                       /    |
                            |
                            
         Two or more stars can be connected through repeaters
   
   4. Mesh
       Each Node is directly connected to every other nodes in the network(Issues with broadcasting messages)
   5. Hybrid
       Combinations of 1 or more topologies

     1. Message Delievery Options:
        
  
     2. **Peer-to-Peer Network**
         Ports: How many devices it can connect
         (i) No centralized adminstration
         (ii)All peers are equal(No superior and Inferior)
         (iii)Not scalable
         
     3. **Client(many ppl) Server(1 server) Network (or) Request-Response model**
         (i) Centralized adminstration
         (ii)Scalable
         (iii))Server may be overloaded
   
**Various Components of Computer Network**

**Basics of IP addressing**
  There are 2 ways
  (i)IPv4(decimal only)   (ii)IPv6
  IP Address = Location of the person
  It is 32 bit
**Basics of Mac addressing** - Physical Address
  Media Access Control, Every Node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAc address
  MAC Address = Name of the person
  It is 48bits(Hexa decimal)
  
**Basics of Port Addressing**
  Port = Communication endpoint
  Fixed port numbers and dynamic port numbers(0 - 65535)
  
**Switching Techniques**
  Switching helps in deciding the best route for data transmission, if they are multiple paths in a larger network

            |
            
    (32 bits)IP address (consits of 2 parts:- 
                       1. Network Id (NID)(8 bits = 256)  --|__ This type won't be sufficient for today so we will go for "CLASSFULL"

           Inorder to reach the process we need port num            
  
   **NOTE**:
      IP address representation in 3 ways:
      1. Decimal(very huge)
      2. Binary
      3. Dotted-Decimal-Representation: 32bits(4 parts- each having 8 bits) 
               
  **CLASSFULL**:
	 starting with 0	      In class A :  32 bits(choosing 1) - remaining (2^31 IP address possible)

    Sending packets(consists of [data|source address|destination] address) from 1 host to another is called casting. It is 2 types
     1. Unicast(1-1)         _ _ _ _ Limited
     2. Boardcast(1-many)---|_ _ _ _ 
                                     Directed
                             
         1. Limited: within the same network, 1 host want to send many hosts (by using limited if you send 1host it will reach to entire hosts by: [data|source code|255.255.255.255|]
          
         2. Directed: sending 1 packet to many hosts in diff network([data|source address|NID.255.255.255])
   </pre>
   
# cls 3:

   SubNeting: Dividing a big network into small network(4 steps required to reach process but adv is more
   Subnet Mask: It is a 32bit number
                No.of 1's represent : what is NID part and SID part
                No.of 0's represent : what is HID
                
          Using subnet mask we can find the where IP address network belongs to(SM & IP = NID)
          
          
        CIDR | subnet masking | wildcard mask | no.of ip address
    
    
    
    In a network if subnet size is different then it is called Variable Length Subnet Masking(VLSM)
     Given a subnet mask, no.of zeros represent the size of network
