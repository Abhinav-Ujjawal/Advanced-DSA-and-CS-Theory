  Use bfs approach by making all possiblities frst
  dp intiliaze -1, if we moved to that mark it as 0

  	  number of vertices with an odd edges is > 2 then no path
  	  if it has even, then we start from any nodes (odd_vertices == 0)
  	  if it has 2, then we start from any 2 vertices (odd_vertices == 2)
  	  there will be no case where exactly one vertex has odd number of edges
  	  
  <b>A spanning tree of a connected graph is a subgraph that contains all of that graphâ€™s
     vertices and is a single tree.</b>
  
  <b>In dfs approach make a visulization of passing and marking nodes for better</b>
